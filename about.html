      <h2>About me</h2><br>
      <p>Hello, I am Dr. Mily Kao. Aside from teaching, I am an active student organization advisor. I have had the
        pleasure of coaching various MUN teams, including online ones, in the last eight years.</p>
      <br>
      <p> This website aims to create a stress-free environment for users to learn MUN. It is my hope that
        users would find the information presented practical, engaging, and easy to implement. This website is also a
        small endeavor to make MUN more inclusive, by providing free and accessible resources to aspiring delegates who might not have
        access to training and support. Not every post-secondary institution has an active MUN Club or a faculty member
        with coaching experience. This is especially so in community colleges and online campuses. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Learning can happen everywhere, both inside and outside the classroom! I highly encourage you to give MUN a try if you
        haven't. You will learn about the United Nations, how states engage one another on the international stage, useful transferrable skills, and many more!</p>
